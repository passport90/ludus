On one hand it's a fighting game where players pick from a collection of robots, each with its strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, Virtual-On is a tank-inspired shooter, meant to be played with dual sticks. And while it shone brightly in the arcades, on the Saturn it merely gives off a dull glint. But don't blame the Saturn for this - blame the game.	https://youtu.be/m2i2JjsajC0	t

The poor quality of the graphics, sound, control, and gameplay indicates that this game could have used another year of development.	\N	t

Though the graphics aren't the best, the sound isn't spectacular, and the gameplay isn't necessarily innovative, it's the most addictive game in recent memory. Like Bomberman, Tetris, and Face Ball, Grid Runner is a gamer's game that pulls you in and never lets go. Expect many hours of increasingly fun doses of aggravation as you strive to conquer each level.	\N	t

This incredible arcade-to-home translation has sports texture mapped graphics and faster gameplay than the original Virtua Cop. While the first Virtua Cop set a new standard for light gun shooters, Sega and the AM2 team have delivered an incredible sequel that takes the concept to a whole new level.	https://youtu.be/APzceGd8lVM	t

Striving to bring in a new era of baseball simulation technology with their "real time motion control" graphics and gameplay (using their proprietary 3-D engine), this game may just make up for the disappointing Slam N Jam '96.	\N	t

However, it doesn't deliver the blood of Mortal Kombat, the body count of Loaded, or the rampant annihilation of innocents of Die Hard Trilogy. Adding insult to injury, Project Overkill also fails to deliver the over-the-top gameplay and excitement found in those titles. While Project Overkill does indeed feature plenty of shooting and dying, players will get that gnawing been-there, done-that feeling after just a few minutes of action.	https://youtu.be/9y589RIBusQ	t

And sure enough, it throws in fighters from the many other SNK fighting games - such as Art of Fighting and the Fatal Fury series. In addition to the normal one-on-one fighting mode, KOF adds a team mode, which pits two of three teams against each other.	https://youtu.be/HW-dR9bADtc	t

Well, not arachnophobia exactly - more like arachnomania.

It's probably the only racing game that awards points for smashing into the opposition, even though the more your car makes contact with others, the more likely it is to blow up, thus ending the game. Perhaps because of this irony Destruction Derby, now in its second installment, continues to be one of the PlayStation's most exciting racing titles.	https://youtu.be/I0hU9qEDT9Y	t

But until the release of King of Fighters '95 and Fatal Fury Real Bout for the Saturn, SNK has had trouble converting its games to the home platform. The burning question: Would Shodown III safely make the transition? The answer: Samurai Shodown III for the PlayStation is really good, but not really great.	https://youtu.be/Axgv7ZRi9Zk	t

However, as an EA Sports product - especially when compared to the mind-blowing new PC version - NHL 97 falls a bit short of the company's usually lofty standards. Or put another way, the game rocks but doesn't go the extra mile.	https://youtu.be/3Sy106uIpOk	t

The concept of futuristic multi-terrain racing on motorbikes is quite cool, and the shots on the back of the box do look awesome. Once the controller is in hand and play has begun, however, a very, very steep learning curve awaits.	https://youtu.be/viY6gZ7N5lg	t

While Mindscape's new Dare Devil Derby for the PlayStation may not be a photorealistic, pedal-to-the-metal speedfest (along the lines of NASCAR Racing or The Need for Speed), the variety of tracks and racing environments are enough to give it long term replay value.	https://youtu.be/1DLYslcLO-Q	t

Sounds good, but it's really a bore.	https://youtu.be/mvCkGPyge9o	t

At least it's always been a fantasy of mine. And while Dark Forces replaces this fantasy with something tangible, the game itself doesn't live up to the dream.	https://youtu.be/EW0E6gHXQjU	t

With two-player simultaneous action, multiple weapons, and extremely hectic gameplay, it rocketed to the top of everyone's wish list when it was translated to the 8-bit NES.

Featuring three-on-three, four-on-four, and five-on-five hockey (and all 27 NHL teams and logos), Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey is a solid first generation title.	https://youtu.be/bFr4R81dz-s	t

When Sega exclusively had John Madden Football (by EA Sports), the Genesis was the system for sports game fans. When a better version came out for the Super Nintendo, armchair quarterbacks took their dollars there. Last year Sony converted many Madden purists with NFL Gameday. And now there's Gameday 97 - a title that should be able to hold its audience while converting any remaining Madden holdouts.	https://youtu.be/exqtV9pq9cI	t

With some nicely done motion capture and play mechanics, this debut title from VR Sports has all the raw materials to hold its own against other soccer games.

There are more "sleeper hits" than ever before in the video game industry, and so many are doing well that companies are starting to market their titles that way. Unlike a true sleeper though, Bust-A-Move 2 doesn't quite live up to the hype - rather it's the latest variation on a color matching puzzle game.	https://youtu.be/bJqPCPcR9zE	t

While it is that, it's also a whole lot more. And though players would hardly expect it, this game is truly innovative and contains an outstanding interface that provides a very exciting, challenging adventure for kids and older gamers alike.	https://youtu.be/EF6D7zBDHms	t

Indeed, if you walk into any software store, it's obvious that PlayStation titles outnumber Saturn and Nintendo games by a huge margin.

Case in point: Acclaim's new NFL Quarterback Club 97 for the PlayStation. Compared to EA's brilliant Madden NFL '97, NFL Quarterback Club 97 is simply second-rate.

This fact alone makes Crystal Dynamics' Blazing Dragons a welcome break from the usual mix of action titles. While Blazing Dragons doesn't have the most innovative gameplay around, it is full of bizarre twists on the usual chivalrous knight stories and fairy tales.

Take Blast Chamber: The year is 2096, and you are a genetically engineered human prisoner born and bred for the sole purpose of competing in a battle to the death for the entertainment of the masses. With a time bomb strapped to your back, you are thrown into a rotating cube with three other competitors. It's a desperate battle to add precious seconds to your "kill-clock" by placing crystals into your reactor. The last player standing is the only player who escapes alive.	\N	t

It seemed only natural for him to materialize in a game, and this effort (based on last summer's hit movie) makes an interesting attempt at bring life to yet another comic book character in video game form.	https://youtu.be/Cm1og7p-4kA	t
313	Blazing Dragons	2	1996-10-03	22	20	1	67	2020-04-22 15:02:17.926139	2020-05-08 08:36:16.278429	Like many a Monty Python skit, Blazing Dragons absolutely should not work...but it somehow does. Cute and cartoony, while still retaining its Pythonesque wit, Blazing Dragons is set in a medieval(ish) kingdom populated by talking, mostly good-intentioned (if occasionally dim-witted) dragons. Blazing Dragons is a refreshing change of pace from the seemingly endless slew of high fantasy, point-and-select adventure titles. This game features a few arcade-style challenges (Dragon Thumb Wrestling and 'Cat'-a-pult target practice come to mind), and even when a puzzle is less than ingenious the good-natured humor keeps the experience rollicking right along.	https://youtu.be/lYPBQBJxuT0	t

Of course, at first the rebels don't trust him, but after he saves their lives a few times, they all come around and accept him as one of their own. This also means this wayward Silencer, the player, gets to waste hundreds of Consortium lackeys (his old allies), and thousands of useless W.E.C. computers that happen to get in the way of a revenge-driven slaughter.	https://youtu.be/UWE1XRxxAes	t

Let's face it, if cool tunes are the most noteworthy feature of a game, why bother? What's even worse is when the hyped soundtrack is full of wretched MIDI-esque tunes as bad as the game - like in Viacom New Media's Slamscape. The result: Slamscape is like some bizarre cross between a cyber-pinball game and Twisted Metal, but nowhere near as cool as the latter.	https://youtu.be/VF8ryfC2kA4	t

Even with Don Bluth-style animation, and a quick decision-making interface, Brain Dead 13 makes no improvement in a decade-old genre that never managed to bring its interactive excitement up to the level of its visuals.	https://youtu.be/0zxWQBpSm8g	t

NHL Powerplay '96 is a competent hockey title, but it lacks the punch that EA's hockey games have on the Genesis... Powerplay '96 feels like a cold, soulless game, and players will derive little of the satisfaction that comes from a well-executed play or a bone-crushing check into the boards.	https://youtu.be/HxRznk8_glk	t

If you like classic side-scrolling platform games like Mario and Sonic, you'll find The Adventures of Lomax to be an enjoyable, challenging, good-looking title. If you're more interested in new ideas or technology, look elsewhere.	https://youtu.be/70hUi_B0CdY	t

Since then, other excellent racing games have hit the streets, including Sega Rally on the Saturn and the racing segment of Die Hard Trilogy for the PlayStation. Because Ridge Racer Revolution is more like a "volume two" than a sequel, the Ridge Racer franchise has, in effect, been lapped. Players expecting big improvements on the original will be very disappointed.	https://youtu.be/T_RtwNK5R2E	t

Consulting with Andretti himself through much of the design process, the developers at EA Sports created an excellent user interface with loads of options. The game offers both Stock Car and Formula One racing, which means junkies from both sides of the track can get their fill. An innovative career system allows players to compete for an entire season of harsh racing, and with over 16 different tracks to take on, replay value is guaranteed.	https://youtu.be/icNuWA52nZQ	t

And now in Mortal Kombat Trilogy the entire Mortal Kombat series (and more) is on one disk. Die-hard fans will lose their heads over all-new moves, finishing techniques, and a new secret character - Chameleon. Players won't find any improvement in terms of control, graphics, or sound from the PlayStation edition of MK3, but they will find a heck of a lot more game.	https://youtu.be/6EYFzNU8EE0	t

One of the first games available for the PlayStation when the machine launched in late 1995, Kileak was a rather unimpressive conversion of a Japanese first-person shooter (complete with a storyline that made about as much sense as the Mission: Impossible movie). But it must have sold pretty well - either that or someone at Sony has a soft spot for imported cheese - because US gamers have now been graced with Epidemic, the unofficial sequel to Kileak.	https://youtu.be/X6glVyStGvQ	t

This shameless transgression, however, can almost be forgiven since the result is one of the better Tetris rip-offs around.	https://youtu.be/NOTByunDHIk	t

This game looks good, plays well, and contains all the features found in a decent sports title. These "VR" games don't fail, they just haven't found themselves yet. And even though VR Soccer plays like every other soccer title released in the last three years, it just might stand above others for one reason: the inclusion of Gary Glitter's arena anthem when the game loads (complete with the "Hey!").	\N	t

Encased in a thick, heavy, double jewel-case, Carnage Heart boasts not only the standard game disc and hefty 30-page manual, but also an additional 58-page, highly-detailed strategy guide (and a lengthy tutorial disc) to help get you better acquainted with this high-brow title. All things considered, it's an overwhelming assemblage of materials that hard-core mech sim/strategy fans will really be able to sink their teeth into (and which will send non-fans into fits of hair-ripping frustration).	\N	t

Several years later, it remains on best-seller lists and continues to generate lookalike games hoping to cash in on its widespread appeal. What's most confounding about Myst is its longevity. While an interesting game, it hardly warrants the fanaticism surrounding it - and this PlayStation port does little to explain the phenomenon.	https://youtu.be/wm9mUxxy_Go	t

But Midway's latest installment of Arcade's Greatest Hits - The Atari Collection 1 - is an outstanding tribute to the once great gaming empire. Bringing together six classic games that launched entire video game genres (and stole countless quarters from gamers), The Atari Collection 1 is a wonderful trip down memory lane. This collection features Asteroids, Battlezone, Centipede, Super Breakout, Missile Command, and Tempest. These conversions to the PlayStation are true to their arcade counterparts and are still a blast to play.	https://youtu.be/3rgN6hz4rAk	t

EA Sports once dominated the sport with their brilliant FIFA series. Worldwide Soccer appeared last year with the introduction of the Saturn but suffered from poor gameplay and substandard graphics. Worldwide Soccer '97 claims its spot at the top of the genre with terrific gameplay, slick polygon-based 3D players, and a level of realism that easily supersedes that of its predecessors.	\N	t

While Bottom of the 9th lost some of its graphical shine and speed on its way over from the PlayStation to the Saturn, it still delivers a decent game of baseball. But decent baseball isn't enough to knock the likes of World Series Baseball II out of the park.	\N	t

Unfortunately, for every addictive port that hits the shelves (Command & Conquer, Myst, and SimCity 2000 to name a few), there's an equal number of games that just don't retain some aspect of the original makeup that made it so great in the first place. Origin's newest Saturn release, Crusader: No Remorse, falls somewhere in between these two categories.	\N	t

Taking the NBA Jam concept yet another step, Hangtime is a two-on-two basketball extravaganza complete with real NBA players, fast action, and mind-shattering dunks. But unless you've been shooting digital hoops in a cave for the past few years, you've seen it all before.	\N	t

Invariably and inevitably, the game in question gets compared to the likes of a Final Fantasy. And if the same sort of innovation and excitement isn't there... Let me put it this way: Though Suikoden may not be groundbreaking, it's definitely good.	https://youtu.be/WJiVf2VfUxY	t

There has yet to be a "Beer and Big Ole Hunkin' Stogie" game, but perhaps that genre should be created for Black Dawn - a game that epitomizes everything everyone who doesn't play games denounces about every video game: excessive, violent, loud, irresponsible, and largely geared to lowest-common-denominator male machismo.	https://youtu.be/AOEkk9mg3Ns	t

Originally released for the PC (it bombed so badly the explosion could be heard on Jupiter), Fox Hunt touts itself as a "comedy spy thriller." And it's about as funny as a double homicide and about as thrilling as a presidential debate.	https://youtu.be/Ffo_aADreQs	t

Virtual pool has all three. The physics feel great: Balls go where they're supposed to and bank realistically (which in my case means my shots fail just like they should). The table is viewable from almost any angle, from right behind the eight ball, to underneath the table itself. Players may even view the action from directly overhead (something only Wilt Chamberlain could hope for in the real world). Control of the cue ball is also excellent: Hitting the ball at different points and speeds creates a wide variety of special effects. And because cue ball control is so good, putting English on the ball is never a problem. The cue stick speed control is awkward at first, but it soon becomes second nature. The PC version's mouse control would be a welcome addition but the Sony Mouse isn't supported.	https://youtu.be/tTMbkJqwJ2g	t

It's a sad trend in video games today; the output improves at an incredible rate while the input stagnates. In other words, you can see millions of colors and hear incredible music, but the gameplay is limited to pressing a couple of buttons.	https://youtu.be/GwZ4dmSzRwg	t

Surprisingly enough, the Mega Man series has remained roughly the same, seemingly untouched by either technology or gaming trends. With this latest release, it is becoming painfully apparent that Capcom must reinvent its indigo hero for the decade ahead or resign itself to re-releasing the original titles on new platforms (without the guise of a sequel).	https://youtu.be/JvVccLuVklg	f

This is an enjoyable, smooth translation and should please the screaming hoards of Saturn fans who've been impatiently waiting their turn. So, check your brain at the door and saddle up for a solid, mindless shooting fest that dispenses with any pretense of strategy.	\N	t

It came out when gamers were paying more attention to the Saturn and PlayStation systems themselves, and weren't giving the new arcade games a fighting chance. In the arcade, Vipers mixed Sega's 3-button fighting subtleties with a cool juggle/combo system that made it a touch more exciting than that arcade classic, Virtua Fighter 2. Luckily, FV is Sega's big end-of-the-year fighter, which means Saturn owners have a chance to experience what the arcade brigade missed.	https://youtu.be/JSN2lqIasfw	t

One must wonder what they're hoping to accomplish. After all, Acclaim's first attempt at this type of game, College Slam, was the bottom of the barrel in terms of graphics and gameplay. And even though NBA Jam Extreme has an all-new engine under the hood, is this offering more than repackaged, marketing-backed junk? Yes and no.	https://youtu.be/oze5A5w6QT4	t

This variation (actually based on the Japanese MTGP 2) is an excellent racing game, combining humor, combat, and competition to the delight of older gamers and youngsters alike. Although MTGP may not have the finesse of sharper, more realistic racers like Sega Rally and Ridge Racer Revolution, few will complain after checking out Motor Toon's gameplay.	https://youtu.be/HyXzOlbi-wE	t

Unfortunately, Street Fighter 3 is still crawling through the thicker recesses of the Capcom development swamp. Fortunately, a brief but important interlude has arrived, in the form of Star Gladiator. By virtue of its visuals alone, this slick 3-D, weapons-based combat title immediately places itself in the hallowed company of Tekken and Toshinden. Is it better than its peers graphically? Perhaps. Is it better than Street Fighter in terms of game concept? Let's just say that graphically it's a step up the ladder.	https://youtu.be/_okx3jPzXM8	t

The graphics are solid and done in the same anime style as the first Alpha. The animation is top-notch, as are the sounds and music. The backgrounds are first rate, giving Alpha 2 some of the best scenery yet seen in a Street Fighter game.	https://youtu.be/ASq2uzRLEHg	t
340	Tobal No. 1	2	1996-10-31	3	4	2	81	2020-04-22 15:58:13.748674	2020-05-08 08:36:16.370691	If the characters in Tobal No. 1 look familiar, it's with good reason: They're the work of Akira Torayama, the artist responsible for those wacky Dragon Ball Z characters. And under the fantastic visuals lies the solid programming muscle from Square - the Japanese firm responsible for the Final Fantasy series. So do these factors mean that Tobal No. 1 is a role-playing game? Yes and no.	https://youtu.be/iEoeT3aPvic	t

You have to have a natural affinity for flippers, rubber bumpers, and steel balls. Scores must be more important than new levels - in short, you have to be a total pinhead. Or in the case of this game, a pinhead who's also a brain-dead Power Rangers fan.	https://youtu.be/evqYkiQyhrk	t
353	Pro Pinball	2	1996-11-04	21	50	1	55	2020-04-23 18:24:57.49742	2020-05-08 08:36:16.378477	Pro Pinball is a good simulation of real pinball. However, a video pinball game should have two overriding features: It should do things that regular pinball can't do, and it should provide replay value by including numerous tables in one package. Unfortunately, Pro Pinball does neither.	https://youtu.be/0rF4g8grQb8	t

That's definitely the case here. Pandemonium's extraordinarily silly (and not very funny) storyline exists only to string together the graphically diverse levels - and make no mistake, the graphics are the main attraction here.	https://youtu.be/afgz4bsfYOM	t

That's all fine and good, but if I wanted to play real pinball, I'd go down to a bowling alley and play a little Black Knight. Video pinball should feature at least two things: It should do things that regular pinball can't do; and it should include numerous tables in one package to provide replay value. Unfortunately, Pro Pinball does neither.	\N	t

While the floodgates have yet to open, one could say a hole has been drilled in the dam and Wave Race is the first thing to trickle out. And if that's the analogy, it's one hell of a water drop.	https://youtu.be/y_3VrjOk8mc	t

However, entering the 3-D world hasn't changed Sonic much. He still runs pretty fast (although not nearly as fast as he did on the old Genesis platform), he still has to regain the Chaos Emeralds, and he still has to beat Dr. Robotnik by jumping on the glass dome of his spherical ship. The only real difference is that Sonic has the freedom to run in many different directions. And while the game doesn't break any new ground from either a technological and story standpoint, it does prove to be good fun with an old-school feel.	https://youtu.be/Q5hnBsUWmAI	t

Even games that are considered great often only do something that has already been done countless times before. And this observation most definitely holds true for racing games. So how does Rally Cross stack up? Suffice to say that this is one of the first PlayStation racing titles that brings innovation to the genre, and it offers a wonderfully entertaining gaming experience.	https://youtu.be/oxkPKSkdr4A	t

Like Pole Position, today's driving games tosses you in a car and challenges you to drive around a track and make it to the checkpoints on time.

This future-sport game has been virtually ignored by enthusiast magazines and by its own distributor, Accolade (which instead frittered away most of its ad bucks on Bubsy 3D and its obnoxious exclamation-point-wearing mascot that hardcore gamers have come to hate). That's too bad, because Pitball is superb.	https://youtu.be/v9w9Ci4HKCk	t

Your character (Kain) is murdered at the beginning of the game, then resurrected in the form of a vampire so that he can exact revenge upon those who have wronged him. As you will quickly discover, revenge is a dish best served at body temperature.	https://youtu.be/jjUlnDyZwQk	t

The plumber assassin comes in the form of a gun-toting, acrobatic beauty by the name of Lara Croft, an archeologist in search of pieces of an ancient artifact, and the woman you guide through 12 levels. Sure, it sounds a lot like Indiana Jones - but Indy never wore short shorts.	https://youtu.be/f-CAGwue6fY	t

Tomb Raider combines slick graphics with a fantastically agile character and an excellent story, offering proof that the 32-bitters can hold their own with the Nintendo 64 and its plumber juggernaut.	https://youtu.be/LCO8R_qZ-cA	t

In addition to a new storyline, players will find new moves and new characters. In this installment, a mystery man has stolen the Toshinhei Replicant and is wreaking havoc on the world. What better way to get to the bottom of this mess than by getting in a ring and fighting it out?	https://youtu.be/J05osG8wqwQ	t

After all, this title has two comic book heroes, Iron Man and X-O Manowar, joining forces to destroy Baron Zemo and Mistress Crescendo and save the world. Iron Man has needed a video game for a long time (after all, he was the first high-tech superhero). This game couldn't miss. Or could it?	\N	t

The storyline is simple enough: Area 51, the top secret military facility 90 miles north of Las Vegas that supposedly conducted biological testing and experiments on alien visitors, has been overrun with mutating alien creatures. The job is to infiltrate the base and wipe out anything that isn't human.	https://youtu.be/AhogLgugpk4	t

The only new twist Amok provides is a couple of underwater levels, which play exactly like the walking levels, except that you're forced to shoot sharks. Going down....	\N	t

Your honor is trampled. Your home, the prosperous kingdom of Verdite, faces annihilation at the hands of a power-hungry warlock's advancing armies. Verdite's last line of defense is the legendary Moonlight Sword, a long lost weapon of immense magical capacity. You are Alexander, royal knight and lone survivor of a perilous sea voyage to the island of Melanat, resting place of the Moonlight Sword. Your objective is all too clear: find the blade and escape.	https://youtu.be/b5KvrbZvmMw	t

The Final Round is beautiful, using 32-bit polygon and texture mapping technology to create lush, realistic 3-D characters and a beautiful and dynamic 18 hole course. The grass actually looks like grass, rather than a flat green block, and the background actually feels far away. The interface is smooth, and the controls are easily picked up after one or two strokes. Ultimately, it's the player against computerized physics and nature - just what every couch potato golfer wants, right?	https://youtu.be/jVDzqrUYbs8	t

But then there are the subtleties - the little things - that can send a game into a league of its own. Whether it's a shattering backboard, a hockey brawl, or a grassy football field turning to mud in a rain storm, sports games need nuances - details that can make even the most experienced gamer howl with delight. And while Acclaim's new Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball boasts the necessary qualities that make for a top-notch baseball contest, it lacks personality in the often overlooked "little things" department.	https://youtu.be/fLaX21kgyLk	t

Aliens invade Tuneland and challenge the Tunes to an intergalactic basketball tournament. But it's not just any pick up game - the outcome decides their eternal fate. Thankfully, basketball hero Michael Jordan steps in to save the day. However, despite the use of much-loved Warner Bros. cartoon characters, Space Jam fails miserably in every category.	https://youtu.be/-Ciq2NEBOxQ	t

Instead, they delivered a sucker punch to unwary gamers. Acclaim does deserve a certain amount of back-handed admiration for producing a game that relies on a concept which played itself out after Streets of Rage in 1991 - and for releasing a Batman game that's nearly two years behind its movie namesake. Gripes aside, Batman Forever: The Arcade Game is the best looking Final Fight clone to come out in years. But as we all know, beauty is skin deep.	\N	t

These include the British Bulldog, Goldust, Bret Hart, Undertaker, and Ultimate Warrior. Each has his own particular ring setting, from the Undertaker's gloomy surroundings (complete with a spider web floor mat and skull turnbuckles), to Ultimate Warrior's outdoor Western locale.	https://youtu.be/aAZirq03hn8	t

While the graphics and sound may improve, the basic premise remains constant: Players drop blocks to block out (so to speak) their opponent. This sameness makes it seem odd that so many puzzle games are released every year - including Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. But the occasional good puzzle game (like Baku Baku) makes the genre seem fresh all over again.	https://youtu.be/UOuSklbrSF8	t

It was a good game to showcase the system's capabilities, though the graphics could have been better, the frame rate higher, and the "pop-up" rate lower. Sega Sports has done its homework, and with Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition, they deliver a very impressive sequel that greatly improves upon the original.	https://youtu.be/2Uq7n2FZb30	t

It combined the swords and magic commonly associated with a role-playing game, and the fighting and special moves expected from a fighting game. Enter Legend of Oasis, the prequel to Beyond Oasis. Sporting the same action as the original Genesis title, and some of the same "spirits" (which are used to cast various spells), Legend of Oasis is a classic example of "been there, done that."	https://youtu.be/XfhnHZWFxX4	t

II for the Saturn. P.T.O. II, which stands for Pacific Theater of Operations, is a text-heavy strategy game where players are responsible for the outcome of various World War II battles and operations, and ultimately the war itself. In other words, P.T.O. II is geared toward those who prefer a long game of Risk, versus the quick-fix death and destruction of, for example, Command & Conquer.	\N	t

Teaming up with Adeline Software, Time Commando's stunning 3-D graphics and innovative gameplay bring action and adventure on the PlayStation to dizzying heights. And as promised, this is a game where the player's only armor is his instinct, and all-out warfare the only choice. Action on the PlayStation is seldom more fun.	https://youtu.be/S8x67VKoEDU	t

Players assume the role of an Allied or Axis commander in strategic-level WWII operations in three campaigns, which means PlayStation owners can now experience desert clashes with Rommel's Afrika Korps forces; the expected Soviet and American operations in Europe; a number of hypothetical alternate-history campaigns (such as Winston Churchill's speculative and slightly wonko Operation Jupiter, a talked-but-never-walked invasion of Norway); and over 35 individual scenarios.	https://youtu.be/30qAczKas1c	t

Psygnosis went to the expense of buying the licenses for all the drivers, tracks, and teams, creating one of the most accurate, detailed, and polished simulations of a sport ever to grace a screen. This realism, combined with its solid game engine, makes Formula 1 an incredible racing experience.	https://youtu.be/pjohH05tq2I	t

The graphics and sound effects are excellent, you have loads of super-destructive weapons at your disposal, and there's enough of a storyline to tie everything together. Put it all together, though, and you don't have much: Machine Head is a prime example of the whole being nowhere near the sum of its parts.	https://youtu.be/XunbaIhL1uI	t

At best, the latest release from VR Sports is a decent golf game that digital links fans will appreciate. However, the game barely scratches the surface of what the PlayStation game machine can do.	https://youtu.be/uhVxO79yyK4	t

Through the years the original has spawned new incarnations that have appeared on Genesis, SNES, and even Game Gear. Now the series makes the jump to 32-bit, with a raw collection of messy operations and too many little problems to recommend it. The sound is dull, the scrolling can get choppy, and the control requires far too much precision. And while the full-motion video is entertaining, and the graphics above average, Soviet Strike simply doesn't play as well as the old 16-bit Strike games.	https://youtu.be/uS5Ta0RHhxA	t

The latter title is no doubt familiar to most PlayStation owners - it was featured on the demo disc that was bundled with the unit. Though 2Xtreme lost the ESPN license, the game itself sports improved graphics, sound, and gameplay - though these elements could have just as easily been delivered on a 16-bit machine. But that doesn't mean 2 Xtreme isn't fun to play, especially in two-player mode.	https://youtu.be/k21LZNP1iho	t

But despite programmers' efforts to spice it up, Spot 3 still resembles the 16-bit versions released months earlier. Only the amazing full-motion video sequences make you realize Spot 3 is playing on a 32-bit system. The upside is that the time obviously not spent on the rather droll graphics was focused instead on gameplay. The result is a batch of very large, diverse, and challenging levels. This is old-school platform gaming at its finest.	https://youtu.be/UC4CXxzRwNE	t

It "floats" the narrow line between staying tame for children and being interesting to adults. To modify a Hollywood cliche, the result is entertainment suitable for the entire family.	\N	t

Tetris' creator, the "famed Russian inventor" Alexey Pajitnov, hasn't stopped trying. He's spent the decade since Tetris' debut creating weaker and weaker (hence forgettable) incarnations of his "perfect" game - Welltris, Faces: Tris III, Bombtris. Tetris Plus was converted from a Japanese coin-op, and not conceived by Pajitnov, but it might as well have been. This game seems like something he'd be desperate enough to try at this point.	\N	t
381	Star Wars: Rebel Assault II - The Hidden Empire	2	1996-11-26	53	3	1	60	2020-04-24 10:11:06.686108	2020-05-08 08:36:16.537417	The original Rebel Assault became one of the best-selling CD-ROM games ever, despite the repetitive shoot-em-up gameplay. Rather, Rebel Assault was a hit because players could become a character in the eternally cool Star Wars universe and engage in activities straight from the movies. John Williams' rousing musical score didn't hurt the game either. And now there's Rebel Assault II - a game that's more of the same, only revved up for the more powerful hardware of 1997. Destined to part Star Wars freaks from their money, Rebel Assault II for the PlayStation boasts live-action footage that is even prettier than it is on the PC. In fact, its gorgeous 16-bit color and true CD-quality stereo sound throughout provide all the ear and eye candy a player could want. But then the game has to be played, and that's where the Star Wars luster begins to fade.	https://youtu.be/7TuVhSS2f0U	t

However, while KI Gold didn't make the initial release (Mario 64 and Pilotwings shared that honor), it is clearly the best fighter currently available on Nintendo's next generation system.	https://youtu.be/d_7mv-ufetc	t

The game sets a new standard of visual excellence for sports games on any console system. The realistic players practically jump off the screen, the play animation couldn't be smoother, and the camera angles provide several great views of the action. (The reflection of the overhead lights off the wood floor looked real enough to send shivers down my spine). If you choose to watch only one basketball game to this year, make sure it's NBA in the Zone 2.	https://youtu.be/1MNQhTTHg14	t

A Doom with heavily-armored vehicles, the original Twisted Metal was a groundbreaking hybrid that outclassed most 3-D shooters and blew the doors of almost all other racing games. The game also had personality - a human element that made you fear certain opponents and hate others, and care enough to spend the time to complete every level. While Twisted Metal 2 certainly ranks among the best PlayStation games of the season, to say that it's "improved" on the original would be inaccurate. And that's a good thing.	https://youtu.be/a2bAnmYVrTE	t

The original Bubsy was a weak Super Mario/Sonic rip-off with one unbelievably major flaw: the player died after taking a SINGLE hit. Bubsy II was better, with tighter level design and weapon power-ups (although one of them was a Nerf Ballzooka, providing for a very ignoble product tie-in; try to imagine Mario wielding a Super Soaker 2000). Yet the sequel still suffered from the fundamental problem of a very irritating lead character. Does Bubsy 3D have graphics and gameplay good enough to overcome Bub and his endless barrage of cat puns? Not quite.	https://youtu.be/JlPuyLGPZEY	t

The result is a confusing amalgam of the two, with the strengths of neither title, and will appeal only to the die-hard fans of the license.	https://youtu.be/TT-j4vpyn6c	t

WWF in Your House adds finishing moves, four-player action, and different backgrounds for each character - backgrounds that replace the plain old wrestling ring.

The game's characters have been turned into six-year-old versions of themselves, with huge heads and eyes in the classic Japanese anime style. The sound bites of each fighter are raised in pitch, making the characters sound cuter. Hard-core VF2 fans may find this adorable; however, the gaming community at large may find the prospects of two children beating the hell out of each other a little disturbing.	\N	f

TNN Motor Sports Hardcore 4X4, however, is truly a racing game. For that reason, and that reason alone, Hardcore 4X4 is a refreshing addition to the PlayStation racing game library. However, the same solid racing focus that makes Hardcore 4X4 stimulating is also the game's biggest downfall: There are no surprises, no changes in gameplay, and nothing to work towards.	https://youtu.be/AKHW1elFpZE	t

Unfortunately, this isn't an improvement. When it comes down to it, Reloaded (actually, the entire Loaded series) is a horrible version of the Atari classic, Gauntlet - the main difference being the enemies. Instead of Gauntlet's massive, unstoppable swarms, Reloaded places a few green guys here and there, and then tosses in the occasional gun emplacement (to get your hopes up). Unfortunately, the gameplay never improves, meaning Reloaded is delivered to the PlayStation DOA.	https://youtu.be/Q01S-g18XFc	t

Nintendo also promised arcade-perfect translations of these titles. They delivered on neither count. Now, after years of wading through rumors and delays, the Nintendo 64 has made it to the store shelves, and so has Cruis'n USA. And while Nintendo's game machine lives up to its billing, Cruis'n USA doesn't even come close.	https://youtu.be/fG_V5YRG5C0	t

The game's glorious first level (in which you take the controls of a snowspeeder in a gallant attempt to destroy evil Imperial Walkers, droids, and other machines on the ice planet of Hoth), is a flawlessly executed piece of video gaming: clear mission objectives, silky smooth controls, outstanding graphics, fantastic sound effects, and a true sensation of flight. I stared at the screen in awe as I made my first approach toward an Imperial Walker. Laser fire screamed past my ship as I angled to connect a tow cable to a Walker and wrap it tightly around its legs. And then it happened: The lumbering monstrosity seized up, its legs buckled, and the beast crashed to the ground in a huge fireball. I felt like jumping out of my chair and shouting to the world: "Yes! Yes! This is what video games should be! This is what I've been waiting for!"	https://youtu.be/WOHkOZTMqq8	t

Make no mistake: This is an action-based role-playing game that's similar to those before. But Dark Savior contains a heavy platform element, and therefore a good portion of the game is spent running across bridges, jumping over rivers, and pushing blocks out of the way. But the rest of the game contains far more depth (and makes up for the occasionally monotonous wandering).	\N	t

Along with Defender and a few other games, Robotron 2084 took its place in the pantheon of video games. Programmed by Eugene Jarvis (who also worked on Defender and more recently Cruisin' USA), Robotron 2084 not only had an awesome look (colorful and busy) but also an innovative control configuration. Instead of a joystick to move and a button to fire, 2084 had two joysticks: one to move and one to fire. This gave player his first taste of 360 degree simulated 3-D action. And luckily, Robotron X for the PlayStation both retains these Eugene Jarvis innovations and ups the ante in terms of graphics and music.	https://youtu.be/h29_swkFnZE	t

It was the greatest skiing game since US Ski Team Skiing for the old Intellivision. Luckily for home gamers and snowboarder fans alike, that old excitement and action come alive again on the PlayStation with Cool Boarders. More than a great snowboarding game, it's a pretty good racer as well.\r\n\r\n	https://youtu.be/T4KstNPQl_A	t

It's not a flawed title because calling it flawed insinuates that some aspects of the game are good. This game is seriously bad right across the board.	https://youtu.be/Rf04kb8dnMM	t

Despite the success of Jam and its many knockoffs, this two-on-two style of gameplay has rarely made a successful crossing into other sports fields. In 1995, Midway Games took the revolutionary concept it pioneered with Jam and made the first ever two-on-two hockey arcade game. The prime directive was wild action and furious gameplay (as opposed to simulated realism). NHL Open Ice was a smashing success in the arcades - and now Midway has faithfully translated their prized hockey equivalent of NBA Jam to the PlayStation.	https://youtu.be/gd0RQq3egEI	t

While the first two volumes of Namco's Museum series boasted classics like Pac-Man, Mappy, and Xevious, the third installment doesn't carry that same head of steam with it. With Namco Classics v. 3, you receive a couple of hits, but have to walk a few dogs as part of the bargain.	https://youtu.be/xyG5XTRSpw0	t

Once again, the company has spent a mound of money on a movie/comic license, then put next to nothing into the actual gameplay. Well known for such ill-advised expenditures (Batman, Judge Dredd, Warlock… the list goes on and on), Acclaim's latest disaster is The Crow: City of Angels, based on the universally panned movie. The game isn't much better (although it must be said that very little could be WORSE than the film), and features some of the worst action sequences and voice-overs in the history of video gaming. This title should prove once and for all that Acclaim has not yet perfected its formula for success.	https://youtu.be/MDZ348fTHc8	t

Even though the intro's psuedo-nudity has been toned down and the name has been changed to Soul Blade for the American audience, the game still remains a 32-bit fighting masterpiece. Like fighting titles before it, this game follows a group of fighters in their battles around the world. The twist: the combatants all wield bladed weapons - a welcome change from the hand-to-hand combat found in most other fighting games.	https://youtu.be/rRftvAq8IyU	t

There's a whole new set of courses, new racers, slick 3-D graphics, and most surprisingly, a four-player simultaneous play option.

Of course there's one big question we're all asking: Does Turok, a game based on an obscure comic book character, actually live up to the lofty N64 standards? Surprisingly, the answer is yes.	https://youtu.be/TrTkfr5xQP4	t

Perhaps attempting to make up for lost time, Sega is bringing Die Hard Arcade to the Saturn right on the heels of the popular Die Hard Trilogy game. The result is a great action/adventure title with a hero that in no way resembles Bruce Willis.	https://youtu.be/H5jstPu2lkE	t

Scud: The Disposable Assassin, a terrific comic book from the demented mind of Rob Schrab, proves the point in spades. The futuristic story centers on Scuds, slim yellow robots sold in vending machines and designed to kill. Once a Scud kills his target, he self-destructs. Through a freak accident, one Scud realizes just how short his future is and decides to keep his now near-death target alive. To pay the hospital bills, Scud goes freelance, killing anything for anyone. Although all of this makes for a cool comic, it doesn't translate well to the Saturn.	https://youtu.be/9_TDQ3VvTqU	t

You know the story: Space Marine discovers his platoon has been wiped out, Space Marine gets pistol, Space Marine opens a can of whoop-ass on an almost infinite number of demons. Saturn Doom contains all the Ultimate Doom and Doom II levels for a grand total of sixty, which by now most of you should be able to complete on the hardest setting with one arm tied behind your back.	\N	t

Inevitably the game disappoints (excluding, of course, Die Hard Trilogy and the Star Trek: The Next Generation pinball machine). Sadly, Fox Interactive's Independence Day does nothing to alleviate my cringing..

And trite or not, there couldn't be a better phrase to describe Sony, a company that's turning the sports video game industry upside down.

Why? Because being the "console boy" I am, they assumed I would give a two-dimensional PC strategy conversion a low rating for not measuring up to my "3D polygonal ass-whooping standards." Guess what? I played Command & Conquer all the way through and awarded it with the highest rating of any game on our site - it occupied every free hour I had (at work and home) for the better part of a month. Needless to say I was very enthusiastic about the PlayStation version rolling across my desk.	https://youtu.be/j7r2lm9oZq8	t

NBA Live 97 and NBA ShootOut 97 have set the model for “next generation” full court action, giving future games shoes bigger than Shaq's to fill. But while NBA titles have the marquee value of Jordan, Rodman, Drexler, Robinson, and their heavily hyped teams, NCAA video games have yet to generate the same excitement; it would seem as if the only people who really care about college basketball are spirited students, college alumni, NBA scouts, point-shaving bookies, and ESPN2.	https://youtu.be/bxZaOPJKuHs	t

Unlike two-player action in ‘Campaign' and ‘War Game,' this is an arcade game – a real-time Battleship for the 90s, if you will.	https://youtu.be/qpBGvc7JmFo	t

They were text-based - big on immersive gameplay but with no graphics or sound to speak of. While they weren't the kind of games you'd show off to your friends, they would keep you up until all hours of the night. Sentient, by Psygnosis, is a rich and rewarding title, the likes of which hasn't been seen outside the PC world in some time - it may have adequate graphics and sound, but the complex gameplay has "text adventure" written all over it.	https://youtu.be/pBhfMQGWtrE	t

While the actual racing can be quite fun, the game lacks the intensity that made games like Need for Speed and Wipeout XL thrilling.

Yes, Princess Toadstool has yet again gotten her royal keister in the sling, and the bad guy gang of Bowser, Boo, et al, have overrun (and apparently redecorated) Mushroom Castle - hanging a collection of magical, wobbly-membraned paintings/portals that portray scenes from the fantastic worlds to which they're connected. Via Mushroom Castle's enchanted murals, players will find vast alternate worlds: Snowing planes of slippery ice slopes; mist-shrouded lagoons containing sunken ships; archipelagos of airborne islands; haunted castles wrapped in perpetual midnight; and red, seething expanses of lava-flooded obstacles. These worlds are slowly filling with monsters, the Princess herself is missing, and only one man can set things right.	https://youtu.be/0ED8iq7pvwo	t

While the graphics are beyond anything fathomable five years ago, most gamers are still unsure of whether the games they are playing today are actually more fun than those of a few years ago.

Lou Albano faded back into obscurity (unless you count his stint as Mario on the Super Mario Bros. Super Show), wrestling, too, faded, droning on in bad time slots with plots that played out like they were written on the back of a bar napkin an hour before the match aired. But lately, WCW has caused a wrestling renaissance of sorts. The writing is still bad, but now it achieves a certain campiness that it lacked in the past. The result is pure comedy - and pure cash. Quick to capitalize on a hot property, THQ has licensed a Japanese wrestling game, added nine WCW wrestlers, and shipped it. The result is a good wrestling game with some familiar faces thrown in for good measure.\r\n\r\n	https://youtu.be/uASf-orOByk	t

Unlike Test Drive: Off-Road and Tokyo Highway Battle (which were exaggerated), or NASCAR and Mario Andretti (which were true to life, yet never left the track), Need For Speed II focuses on realistic racing in populated settings... and the chaos that ensues.	https://youtu.be/SLEd0wUavtU	t

One of the most ironic things about VR Baseball '97 is that it has been in production for about two years, yet it looks very rushed. The finishing touches that usually make a game feel complete (intuitive menus, crisp animation, and finely-tuned game control) are conspicuous by their absence. VR Baseball '97 is pastiche of features, graphics, and other little things that just don't mesh together.	https://youtu.be/dej1DM2VKhQ	t

Since then, we've seen versions for every system that could handle it, from Sony's PlayStation to Sega's ill-conceived 32X add-on, with varying results. While most would argue that Doom is finally dead, Midway is attempting to keep the series alive with its latest release, Doom 64 for the N64.

Fighters Megamix is the only fighting game a Saturn owner needs. At its heart, Fighters Megamix is a character-driven game. That is to say, it combines all the fighters from Virtua Fighter 2, every one of the fighters from Fighting Vipers, a couple of worthies from Virtua Fighter Kids, and a mess of characters from other Sega titles, including Janet from Virtua Cop 2, and Siba, a character rumored to have been cut from the original Virtua Fighter. One of the more bizarre characters is - believe it or not - the Hornet from Daytona USA that grabs opponents with one tire and uses another to lay a patch on the victim's face.

Some games, like Command & Conquer, work well as both PC and console games, but others need major tweaking and end up as entirely new entities (which are based on the original). MechWarrior 2 for the Saturn is a perfect example of the latter. Taking the “walk around as a robot and blow stuff up” premise of its hit PC title MechWarrior 2, Activision has created a special Arcade Combat Edition for the consoles to better suit console gamers' tastes. The result is a good reworking of the original that may disappoint fans of the PC version's detail and realism, but should ultimately win over the adrenaline crowd.	\N	t

I'm also fairly sure that you spent a great deal of time sitting around in your backyard filling up hapless Tonka trucks with dirt, sticks, and rocks - and making engine noises with your lips that would leave anyone within a three mile radius of you covered in saliva. Unfortunately those halcyon days of youth have passed, and we must move on to more adult pursuits. Like Nintendo's newest N64 title, Blast Corps. In this frighteningly entertaining new cart, developers Rare have gone all out, combining nuclear weapons, giant robots, construction vehicles, AND load motor noises in one title.

The name was kind of goofy, the gameplay was strange, and yet somehow... it was still fun to play. Typically when a company has a surprise hit like this, it's quick to make a sequel and cash in on the hype.

The fourth and most video intensive of the Wing Commander series has made its way to the PlayStation. Too bad it's taken about two years to get here.

All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas is a good example of a feature-heavy game that has adequate play control and adequate graphics.

After over ten years of playing Zelda or Dragon Warrior clones, the average gamer requires something more than the standard wander, kill, wander, solve puzzle, wander game. Final Fantasy VII had its stunning graphics, Dragon Force had its multiple play options, and Suikoden had its monumental cast - that's why they stood out against the backdrop of similar titles, and that's why they were great. Sony's latest US RPG, Wild Arms, takes a different approach. And although none of its component parts could be considered breathtaking, the game does EVERYTHING really well. The result is a fantastically entertaining and well-rounded product well worth the price of admission.	https://youtu.be/qzbGDnQOKhQ	t

With so many first-person shooters released over the last two years, it's really hard to bring something new to the table. And while Codename: Tenka tries to stand out from the crowd, only its crouch feature (which lets you crawl through air ducts and other low-level passages) truly sets it apart from the pack.	\N	t

That's how I felt about War Gods. Let me put it this way: I'm a huge fan of the Mortal Kombat series, and War Gods possesses enough similarities to make it seem like an old friend at times. It also includes enough changes to give the Mortal Kombat fighting experience a "new" feel. Sounds good, right? Well...let's just say that, ultimately, the new feel I got was one of irritation and disappointment.	\N	t

Unlike many compilations, there isn't a bad egg in the batch. Asteroids, Battlezone, Centipede, Missile Command, Tempest, and even Super Breakout are all testaments to the axiom: "Gameplay is where it's at."	\N	t

It's also the first game in the series that can be defined as a pure RPG (Shining in the Darkness, Shining Force, and Shining Force II were RPG-strategy hybrids). This switch to a new format hasn't hurt the title, and Shining the Holy Ark shows itself to be a strong, if not particularly novel, RPG release (which is something of a novelty in and of itself in this day and age).	\N	t

However, Sony's premier football title, NFL GameDay, was so impressive that EA was faced with either shipping an inferior product or going back to the drawing board and waiting a year. They chose the latter, and the result is Madden NFL 97.	https://youtu.be/wnLoJXTCcbQ	t

Players jaded by performing the same moves with the same characters for years, take note: Capcom managed to put it all together in Street Fighter Alpha 2, creating a fantastic fighting package that mirrors the arcade version.	https://youtu.be/mRPTQxXZbSs	t

These forgotten games begin in relative obscurity, but slowly and surely, if they're lucky, they garner die-hard and hard-core fans and gain "sleeper" hit status. Altus' Persona for the PlayStation easily qualifies as a sleeper hit.	\N	t

Featuring all 29 NBA Teams plus two all-star teams (each team has 12 active roster slots plus injured reserve), over 300 real NBA players, including rookies on updated rosters, exhibition, season, and playoff modes, NBA Live 97 has it all.	https://youtu.be/Q5QzSkfVg7I	t

Each edition contains multiple games, and the entire collection creates a retro-80s...museum? This first volume features Pac-Man, Pole Position, Rally-X, New Rally-X (go figure), Bosconian, something called Toy Pop, and the mighty Galaga. These titles are, without exception, true to their original stand-up arcade machines.	https://youtu.be/MlA_-o-mjbo	t

For months, Naughty Dog Software insisted that Crash Bandicoot isn't Sony's answer to Super Mario 64. For months they went so far as to say that the games are completely different and shouldn't be compared. But the comparison is irresistible. Crash may not offer the graphical smoothness or versatility of Mario's vast new world, but its brilliantly colorful and complex jungle environments boast true diversity of shape and texture - kind of a tiki room Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Look beyond the pretty pixels, however, and Crash weighs in at only slightly above average.	https://youtu.be/9HtPF0ers1w	t

With new tracks, weapons, and ships, and improved graphics, Wipeout XL is one of the top second generation titles for the PlayStation this quarter. Wipeout XL has six all-new tracks and two hidden bonus tracks. There are fifteen ships, seven more than the original game. Each ship's strengths and weaknesses appear right on screen: top speed, turning ability, shield level, energy level, thrust, and aerodynamics. Wipeout XL's turning has been fine tuned, making it much tighter, yielding superior control and "road hugging." The weapons in the original Wipeout slowed the opponent down but yielded little satisfaction. In the sequel, it is possible to completely eliminate a weak opponent from the race. The earthquake weapon is unspeakably awesome.	https://youtu.be/kzmmLeCwL0g	t

The result is a 32-bit game that seems somewhat thrown together. Comic fans may get a kick out of this title, but the game drops squarely into "average" territory, offering nothing new to a genre that peaked on the 8-bit Nintendo.	https://youtu.be/tEsuMumMlIw	t

It's one of the best buys for the PlayStation, and one of those rare games that's almost as entertaining to watch as it is to play.	https://youtu.be/ArlQ91tX2JU	t

Beyond the Beyond is an important title in that it's the first "old school" style RPG released for the PlayStation (unlike newcomer hybrids, such as King's Field). As such, it could open the door for better "classic style" RPGs in the future.	https://youtu.be/5i11kPaBUpk	t

Not only are all three games hands-down good, but they're all also very big and replayable. Die Hard takes you through more than 15 brutally intense levels of the Nakatomi Plaza. But what separates Die Hard from a run-of-the-mill shooter is the need for strategy over firepower. Players must learn to hide John McClane behind walls, and out-think and ultimately ambush the enemy. This first installment of the trilogy is extremely challenging, and brute force just won't get McClane through it alive. Think of this game as a Resident Evil, only with more action and strategic elements. Action games simply don't get better.	https://youtu.be/RVovt4dBcOM	t

Professional wrestling (as anyone who's regularly glued to the TV knows) at its best is a spectacle worthy of an Emmy nomination, complete with fake blood, breakable props, shameless actors, and dirty fighting. Power Move, however, is pro wrestling without all the bells, whistles, and eye-gouging that make wrestling one of America's most beloved guilty pleasures. Essentially, the final result is a fairly clean (i.e., boring) wrestling game that features generic muscle men with names like El Tremblor, the Commandant, and Chaingang, who are all wrapped in a polygonal package similar to Sega's Virtua Fighter. While gameplay elements of Power Move Pro Wrestling are solid for the most part, the game lacks any real personality or lasting appeal.	https://youtu.be/DoUFpk7SJ-I	t

The huge number of possibilities was therefore simplified to a few dozen potential results. The result was that most average players could learn to bowl a 300 game after a few lines. But that all changed when Tin Pin Alley struck the PlayStation.	https://youtu.be/_oND2auEtnE	t

Taking gaming back to the days of Double Dragon and Final Fight, Batman Forever revisits old territory and comes back empty. Players become either member of the Dynamic Duo, and then run around beating the hell out of Riddler's and Two-Face's thugs. The only really "new" feature is a completely skill-free combo system - one that comes down to pounding buttons fast and making enemies die. In other words, this game is really all about mashing buttons.	https://youtu.be/_--Ft5HVvF4	t

The game's flat yet photo-realistic graphics proved it the best-looking title on this ill-fated platform. And with the addition of Konami's "Justifier" light gun, playing the game became a truly unique thrill in an era of side-scrolling Sonic knockoffs. With all of the technology available today (not to mention the Konami's arcade heritage and history), it seemed reasonable to assume that Konami's newest title would put all others, including the excellent Lethal Enforcers, to shame. Unfortunately, with its latest game Crypt Killer (the home translation of the coin-op), Konami has done an about-face, producing a game unfit to shine Lethal Enforcer's shotgun.	https://youtu.be/1rZ0N8VBfMQ	t

Unsafe? You bet! Especially when you consider Japan's notorious seismic instability. Sure enough, the quakes strike, smoking 60 percent of Japan's populace. Energy being the scarce commodity that it is, Russia decides to strike while the iron's hot and "re-appropriate" everything left standing. This aggression clearly must be stopped - and that's where you, and the game, come in. As the pilot of the TigerShark ship (which is convenient because the game is called TigerShark), you're in control of what GT Interactive describes as "the ultimate war machine." If this is true, then we're all in trouble - not only is the TigerShark subfoil (think sub meets F-16) difficult to control, but its weaponry is, in a word, pathetic.	https://youtu.be/BKw0A96dCjM	t

Now that you've returned to me I will be able to conquer the world… Er, sorry. It's hard not to be excited by LucasArts' triumphant remake of the Commodore 64 classic Ballblazer. Filled with everything that made the original great, along with better graphics, sound, and control than the Commodore ever could have delivered (yes, I know it's sacrilege, but it's true...), Ballblazer Champions has everything that a remake could want.	https://youtu.be/fU2x9nFzm_o	t

In this 3-D hunter/gatherer you play a prehistoric knuckle-dragger on a quest to, well, exist. Existing entails sleeping, eating berries - actually, they're obviously Japanese sugar cookies, please just don't even ask - hunt down creatures residing on the lower rungs of the food ladder, procreate, and ultimately croak on some godforsaken, windswept tundra. Along the way, you'll develop new skills and weapons for your tribe, which will prepare you to go after the bigger game; specifically, the mammoth, which not only provides scads of meat, but valuable tusks which are used to create your tribe's greatest cultural achievement: The Irritating Control Scheme.	https://youtu.be/Qaqzyg3_kHs	t

The original Ridge Racer, which launched with the machine, attracted tons of people to the system. Ridge Racer Revolution came along in the fall of 1996 and left many people disappointed with the lack of changes. Even so, it was a solid racing game. Now Rage Racer is out. So how is it? The gameplay remains the same, though the objectives of the actual race have changed completely.	https://youtu.be/mEXLovABSy4	t

The premise is simple: You fly around futuristic space mines in a souped-up craft with an array of weapons at your disposal and plenty of enemy robots to blast. While navigating these obstacles in a true 3-D environment, you must accomplish each mission objective then find your way out before the mine blows in a decidedly Star Wars-like fashion.

First there was Sonic the Hedgehog. Earlier this year we were introduced to Nights. Now Sega trots out a new character with attitude - Mr. Bones. Created by a team of pretty ingenious dudes at Zono Inc., Mr. Bones is a cool, musically interactive, multi-level scroller that's surprisingly fun to play.	https://youtu.be/yH51EGu8bTQ	t

The ball action is fast and fluid, and the sweet SGI graphics create the most realistic flipper and bumping action available to date. Many of the features of real pinball are here, including: scrolling marquis-style displays, skill shots, sling shots, jet bumpers, loops, rollovers, kickbacks, jackpots, multiple ramps, ramp targets, double return lanes, super spinners, combination bonuses, multiple multi-ball options, hidden areas, and video modes. The machines can even be tilted if they're rocked too hard!	\N	t

After hours of dismantling punks with a hand cannon, does the average console gamer really want to load up a peaceful respite on the links? Apparently so. And the success of PGA Tour 96, one of the most popular golf games to travel through the fairway, is a testament to this fact. But it's tough to score a golf game, especially after you just eviscerated some dude on your screen. What is there to say about a golf game? I mean, it's golf. But when it comes down to it, video game golf (though it may yank you by your pale-yellow Polo collar back to the unbearable ennui of those sedated Sundays, leaning over a cylinder of Pringles in front of the TV), has an unexplainable air of intensity to it. The gameplay in PGA Tour 97, though a tad on the dull side at times, is still calming in the way you'd expect a golf game to be, and (like its predecessor) is fairly challenging. The graphics may not be as glassy-smooth as the PlayStation version, but avid fans of console golf games will still wish they had a putter to crack over their knees when they miss that critical shot for par.	\N	t

If they're rooted in Asian history (the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, for example) they're great; but when Koei strays into unfamiliar territory (anything other than Asian history) they're horrid. Heir of Zendor is an example of the latter. Simply: Heir of Zendor has the worst graphics I've ever witnessed in a Saturn title (I was half-expecting the Saturn to eject the CD across the room in disgust), and gameplay that's about as exciting as a typical episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.	\N	t

It may have puzzles, and you may be able to move around, but it isn't really a game. Normally, such a game would anathema to any serious gamer, but in the case of Lunacy for the Saturn the game's enthralling storyline saves it. The plot of Lunacy involves a mysterious city where all your wishes come true (think the Nexus in Star Trek: Generations). Fred, the game's hero, bears the mark of the city's visitors (a crescent shaped tattoo on his head) and can't remember anything about his past. Unfortunately for Fred, he winds up in the City of Mists where Lord Gordon is obsessed with finding the magic city. As Fred you have to make your way to the mystical land while uncovering as much of your forgotten past as possible.	https://youtu.be/6o1VTTfCEbU	t

The player takes control of Miranda Bowen, aka The Harbinger, and must rout an alien menace before it heralds in the apocalypse. The twist to this tired plot: The Harbinger (while killing aliens and rescuing humans), must eat her victims, humanoid and alien alike, to regain energy. The result? A grisly, action-packed joyride.	https://youtu.be/aT4HyMwLzP8	t

Not content with simply porting over last year's polygon-enhanced Xevious sequel, Xevious 3D/G, the creators of Pac-Man have gone the extra mile and included the entire Xevious arcade series on one PlayStation disc. Sadly, Xevious 3D/G, the game's showcase title, is plagued with so much slowdown it may scare away all but the most fanatical of shooter fans.	https://youtu.be/0OqWbSZ_TnE	t

It was a good game, but it suffered from repetitive and eventually tiresome gameplay. When Toshinden 2 came along, everyone was expecting an amazing sequel. Unfortunately what they received was a rehash with slightly better graphics and the same boring gameplay. Toshinden 3 is what Toshinden 2 should have been - an improved version of the original, with a ton of new characters and improved play mechanics.	https://youtu.be/rRByoE2Avpw	t

Sure, the Super Nintendo and the 3DO had versions of Wing Commander, and the PlayStation has Wing Commander IV, but they all seem to fall a little flat when put up against their PC counterparts. EA's Darklight Conflict also began life as a PC title, but it translates quite well to the PlayStation.	https://youtu.be/hHnDyQ-LL5o	t

Koei's Dynasty Warriors is a welcome exception to this rule.	https://youtu.be/FgjgJGElfZY	t

The Nintendo 64 has already had its first original sports game, its first shooter, its first racing game, and its first arcade translation. Dark Rift is the system's first native fighting game. And if indeed this game helps to define the Nintendo 64, it chalks up another point in the "not bad, but I wouldn't actually pay money for this game" column.	\N	t

Strangely enough, the games not related to that galaxy far, far, away seem to stand up on their own, and most have one thing in common: a healthy dose of offbeat humor. From The Secret of Monkey Island, to Sam and Max Hit the Road, to Afterlife, LucasArts has been putting out a solid amount of these "games with an edge," and its latest addition, Herc's Adventures for the Saturn, continues the tradition. The result is a game that offers a lot of fun and amusement, which is something that most Saturn games have been lacking lately.	\N	t

Albert Odyssey fits the description of the better 16-bit RPGs, complete with sprite-based graphics and a good story. Released as Albert Odyssey Gaiden in Japan, Working Designs has polished the game's interface and translated the script to English for release in the US.	\N	t

Based on the arcade game of the same name, Manx TT is significantly better than Sega's last Saturn motorcycle racer, the dismal Hang-On GP. However, despite the obvious gameplay improvements and smooth-flowing graphics, the limited number of tracks may scare off all but the hard-core players. Manx TT fails to deliver what only an exceptional few racing games possess: long-lasting play experience.	https://youtu.be/uUqasEsemQQ	t

The former 3DO game and new PlayStation title from Acclaim, BattleSport, belongs to the latter group.	https://youtu.be/-j3A318o39I	t
504	Disney's Hercules Action Game	2	1997-07-03	13	1	1	78	2020-05-08 15:23:29.171727	2020-05-08 15:23:29.171727	Virgin Interactive has brought the magic of Disney's animated motion picture Hercules to the PlayStation - awkwardly-named Hercules Action Game. Hercules is a side-scrolling action-adventure game that puts you in the role of the mighty Hercules on quests that follow the movie's storyline to the letter. In fact, players that have seen the movie actually have an advantage because the movie shows how Hercules beats some of the same bad guys that you must defeat in the game. Although Hercules is a 2D side-scrolling game, it possesses some unique features that put it in its own class. The use of the Z-axis lets Hercules move in and out of background scenery, giving the game a pseudo 3D look and feel. The other feature that truly makes Hercules fun is the constant interaction that Herc has with his surroundings. For instance, you must use Herc's amazing strength to pick up giant boulders to throw at enemies or use Herc's powerful fists to knock columns and other obstacles out of your way.	https://youtu.be/lNtazzM5K5A	t

Virgin just released the Hercules Action Game, based on Disney's summer blockbuster, which has met with pretty good reviews. How does this similarly-themed title, based on the same subject matter, stack up? Pretty well, thanks to its unique approach and interjection of humor into the game - providing you're into bad puns and offbeat dialogue.	https://youtu.be/NKEqh7BQ1IE	t
506	Syndicate Wars	2	1997-07-17	8	75	2	62	2020-05-08 15:26:59.461635	2020-05-08 15:26:59.461635	When Syndicate Wars came out on the PC, it didn't fare as well as its competitors at the time (Command & Conquer, Warcraft, and so on) or the original Syndicate. For whatever reason, it wasn't a big enough jump forward, and the other real-time strategy titles burning up the charts were far superior. Syndicate Wars for the PlayStation, a port of the PC title, feels even more outdated - but with only a few real-time strategy titles to compete with, it warrants a look.	https://youtu.be/goLqfFtAhF4	t
507	Namco Museum Vol. 4	2	1997-07-17	4	10	1	57	2020-05-08 15:28:16.967861	2020-05-08 15:28:16.967861	The Namco Museum series is just about out of steam. The first two volumes were spectacular; almost every game was worth owning. Volume 3 had about a 50 percent hit ratio. Volume 4 is just plain depressing. It contains five games, and most of them are little known games that were little known for a reason.	https://youtu.be/RjUaUOIj5pI	t

Nothing about MLB 98 really grabs my attention and I think my time could be better spent playing Golgo 13. Sure, MLB 98 has all the features a person would expect from a 32-bit baseball game, but it doesn't necessarily provide a more enjoyable game of baseball than any other title.	\N	t

VMX Racing is this quarter's dog. The graphics are shoddy, the sound is pathetic, and there are several Genesis games that control far better. To be honest, I would rather have teeth pulled than be forced to play this game.	https://youtu.be/SwKv20fuKxA	t

He is easily Nintendo's greatest asset, and one of the most brilliant storytellers ever to work in the interactive medium. His latest effort, Star Fox 64, is a game designed in his tradition of greatness, and it's perhaps the best N64 game seen since Super Mario 64 - which is still considered by many as the best video game of all time.	https://youtu.be/ajLFEw_LCg8	t

In fact, with the amount of expectation placed on EA Sports to deliver, anything short of the Holy Grail of soccer games would have been considered a disappointment. As we all know, FIFA Soccer 64 is an OK game, but hardly what we all expected it to be. Now that J League Perfect Striker has been tweaked and is finally coming out in the US, guess what? It's actually better than FIFA Soccer 64.	https://youtu.be/anm7_zC9sk4	f

It's strangely ironic that in 1997, the Sonic franchise is Sega's flagship series for its 32-bit Saturn that in no way competes with Nintendo's revolutionary Super Mario 64 for the N64. A true 32-bit Sonic title has yet to be released - last year's Sonic 3-D Blast was a port of a 16-bit title, and the latest Sonic game, Sonic Jam, is a retrospective of the Sonic 16-bit cartridges with a 3D "Sonic Museum" tagged on that offers little in the way of interest. A racing game, Sonic R, will be out later this year, but will it be enough to save the series?	https://youtu.be/gMes5SFd1vc	t

The name of the game is resource management, cleverly disguised under the auspice of war. You choose sides over two different scenarios of orc vs. human conflict, adapted from the PC title Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and its expansion pack, The Dark Portal, and then throw down the gauntlet from an overhead perspective.	\N	t

And for months, US Saturn owners waited patiently, wondering what was taking so long. Turns out Sega felt the need to add NetLink support to the game, letting four people (are there still four people that actually use the NetLink?) duke it out over the Internet. Other than that and a few voice changes, the game mirrors the Japanese version closely.	https://youtu.be/eJornSIIM6Q	t

Literally one out of every five titles being released right now is a driving game of some sort, and it's getting harder and harder to tell them apart. Falling smack dab in the middle of this indistinguishable landscape is Porsche Challenge, an arcade-style racing game from Sony for the PlayStation that stands out in no way, shape, or form except for its official endorsement from Porsche, maker of very expensive sports cars.	https://youtu.be/IjWuUcUqxRQ	t

The first of these is NCAA Football 98, a pigskin title that isn't much more than last year's Madden 97 painted in college colors.	https://youtu.be/n9xqMzPlKPQ	t

For some unknown reason, most game companies have decided that if it isn't a first-person, in-your-face Doom clone or the latest rip-off of Virtua Fighter or Tekken, it isn't worth producing. Fortunately, this isn't the case in Japan, where games like RayStorm, Taito's incredibly intense new space shooter for the PlayStation, are still being released frequently. Those thirsting for an amazing old school shooting experience can relax - your game has arrived.	https://youtu.be/EjRfGspPbjU	f

It was one of the first PlayStation games, and it just lacked anything interesting. The dogfighting was boring, the missions were dull, and the game was too short. Ace Combat 2 fixes every single problem that troubled the first game. The only thing that slightly mars this otherwise amazing game is the difficulty level. Sure, there are a lot of levels, but most of them are very easy. The result is a great game you'll be done with in about two days.	https://youtu.be/UUCZkSrdgUQ	f

The series' content makes for a perfect fighting game: lots of flying guys, all of whom have the ability to shoot fireballs. Several Dragon Ball fighting games are already on the Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and PlayStation, none of which have seen the light of day here. Dragon Ball Final Bout is out in Japan, and it's likely that it will be the first DB game to be released stateside. While Dragon Ball Final Bout is probably among the best DB games around, that still doesn't make it a good game - and it is not a good game.	https://youtu.be/nCVjlcNByqg	f

NFL GameDay '98 is proof that the PlayStation is capable of accomplishing such feats.	https://youtu.be/CfL8RIrXld8	t

Hardly enough to dent the demand brought on by the recent release of Final Fantasy 3, many desirous gamers never got a chance to play Ogre Battle's 16-bit incarnation. Atlus's PlayStation version is identical to the Super Nintendo version, save for a handful of cosmetic changes.	https://youtu.be/yidU9-L6Ag4	f
